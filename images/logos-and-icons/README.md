# Logos & Icons Pack for Emby

In case you want the files locally, here is what to do :

* Select the color you want and just overwrite the 2 files **"mblogoicon.png"** and **"logo.png"** here :

  \dashboard-ui\css\images\

Note : 
* There is also a light version for **"logo.png"** under the folder **"Light"** for each color.
* The file **"checkmarkgreen.png"** is only needed if you are before Emby version 3.0.5930.
